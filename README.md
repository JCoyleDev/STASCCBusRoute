# Spokane Transit Authority SCC Bus Route
This project is a work in progress. The goal of the project is to show the realtime bus location on the SCC bus route in Spokane, WA. At the moment only the route and stop markers are showing on the map.

# How To Run:
-Open the file in a browser window  
-Use mouse wheel to zoom in and out  

# Future Improvements:
-Realtime location tracker  
-Other available and viewable bus routes apart from the SCC route
